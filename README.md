# Booth-multiplier

## Problem Description

Booth's multiplication algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that multiplies two signed binary numbers in two's complement 
notation.

## Implementation

Booth's algorithm can be implemented by repeatedly adding (with ordinary unsigned binary addition) one of two predetermined 
values A and S to a product P, then performing a rightward arithmetic shift on P. Let m and r be the multiplicand and 
multiplier, respectively; and let x and y represent the number of bits in m and r.
